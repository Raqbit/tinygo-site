TinyGo has a `machine` package that lets you control hardware directly. The various interfaces in this package are described in these guides:

  * [GPIO](gpio/)
  * [I2C](i2c/)

For details on what is supported on each chip, see the [documentation of each microcontroller board](../microcontrollers/).
